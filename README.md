# Kickstage AOCS Design

This repository holds the report, source code, and documents related to my attempt at completely redoing my undergrad capstone project, an attitude and orbital control system for a kickstage spacecraft. The original source code can be found at [MichaszJ/capstone-work](https://github.com/MichaszJ/capstone-work).

## Why?

I feel that I made many mistakes while working on this project during undergrad and did not end up with a result I'm happy with. Since then, I've learned a lot more and have the time to do things properly without being rushed by school.

## How?

Like my previous attempt, I will be using the Julia programming language to do all the calculations, analyses, simulations, tests, etc. related to this project. I will be using LaTeX to typeset the report that will summarize my results. I am attempting to create a fully reproducible set of results, thus I am using Quarto documents to conduct all the necessary computations involved in this project.
